# Build Your Own Lisp

The book [Build Your Own Lisp](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/) covers the implementation of a Lisp interpreter in C.

This repository is my work through the book. For the most part the code should be similar but I may change a few things in the code, so please refer to the book site for the original. This is not meant to be used for production code.

## Compiling

Requires GNU readline.

Compile with:
```
cc -std=c99 -Wall parsing.c mpc.c -lreadline -o parsing
```
